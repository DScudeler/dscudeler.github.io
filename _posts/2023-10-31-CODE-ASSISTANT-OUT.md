The Code Assistant Visual Studio Code extension is out.  
Just like every other projects, this small project was mainly done in order to play with LLMs (LLama2 here) and VScode extensions.

The goal here was to see if it was easy to setup a local environment with requests to LLMs and having the answers in an interactive way.
I also used this project to check how
- gRPC (I had some projects in CORBA and Java RMI)
- VS Code extensions (made some JS in the old days, I wanted to see some typescripts)
- LLama2
  
work.

The server part is not provided but might be published in the future.
